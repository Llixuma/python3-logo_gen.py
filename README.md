# python3-logo_gen.py
A port of the semi lost qcom logo_gen.py to python3  
this is part of my Nokia 6300 4G AOSP conversion but i'll leave the semi working non sepecific version seperate for other devices, that also dont have an extractable splash partition.


## The script requires extraction of your device's original splash partition to determine the size of the generated splash.img

  
If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions on how to improve the script, please contribute by opening a merge request with the needed changes.
